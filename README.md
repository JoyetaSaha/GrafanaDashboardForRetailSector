Dashboard For Retailer Perfomance

This project is a production-style Retailer Performance Dashboard built for Jisp, designed to deliver actionable insights into retailer engagement, shopper behavior, and campaign effectiveness.

The dashboard enables stakeholders to analyze performance across multiple Business Union Types (e.g. Nisa, Wholeseller, NFRN etc) while also allowing drill-down analysis at an individual retailer level. It was built using SQL-driven data modeling and interactive Grafana visualizations.

🚀 Insights:

 Which retailers and business types are driving the most engagement?
 How does shopper behavior change over time?
 Are campaigns generating repeat shoppers or just one-time?
 What is the ROI of redemptions by retailer, brand, and voucher?
 How do demographics (age & gender) impact redemption behaviuor?
